# Writing a TypeDoc Plugin

TypeDoc supports plugins which can modify how projects are converted, how converted symbols
are organized, and how they are displayed, among other things. Plugins are Node modules which
export a single `load` function that will be called by TypeDoc with the {@link Application} instance
which they are to be attached to. Plugins should assume that they may be loaded multiple times
for different applications, and that a single load of an application class may be used to convert
multiple projects.

Plugins may be either ESM or CommonJS.

```js
// @ts-check
import td from "typedoc";
/** @param {td.Application} app */
export function load(app) {
    // todo: Add event listeners to app, app.converter, etc.
    // this function may be async
}
```

Plugins affect TypeDoc's execution by attaching event listeners to one or many events that will be
fired during conversion and rendering. Events are available on the {@link Application}, {@link Converter},
{@link Renderer}, and {@link Serializer}/{@link Deserializer} classes. There are static `EVENT_*` properties on those
classes which describe the available events.

The best way to learn what's available to plugins is to browse the docs, or look at the source code
for existing plugins. There is a list of currently supported plugins at https://typedoc.org/guides/plugins/

TypeDoc also provides several control hooks for plugins to change it's behavior, they are described
by the [third party symbols](./third-party-symbols.md) and [custom themes](./custom-themes.md) documents.

Plugins which are configurable can add custom options with `app.options.addDeclaration`. [typedoc-plugin-mdn-links]
has an example of the recommended way of doing this.

To figure out what events a plugin should listen to, it is useful to have a high level understanding of how
TypeDoc works. The [development page](https://typedoc.org/guides/development/) on the website describes this.
